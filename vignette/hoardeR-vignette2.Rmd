# Installation

The installation of hoardeR is straight forward, it is located on Cran and can be installed with the 
command

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hoardeR")
```

There are no special requirements for the installation, however there are a few package dependencies that have to be met.
Normally, these dependencies should be installed automatically, if not, missing Cran packages can be installed as above, with

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("packageName")
```

and missing Bioconductor packages (e.g. the package _Biostrings_) with 

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Biostrings")
```
